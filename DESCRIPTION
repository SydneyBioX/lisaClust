Description: lisaClust provides a series of functions to identify and visualise 
    regions of tissue where spatial associations between cell-types is similar.
    This package can be used to provide a high-level summary of cell-type 
    colocalization in multiplexed imaging data that has been segmented at a 
    single-cell resolution.
